Naive Bayes Introduction
======

![](images/dare_to_be_naive.jpeg)

Naive Bayes is a fundamental machine learning algorithm. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is one of the useful and commonly used classification algorithms. This talk will cover how the algorithm works and implement the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. Common use cases and practical examples will be shown. This talk is designed for beginners who have an interest in machine learning, prior exposure to probability and Python would be helpful to get the most out of it. By the end, you should have a deeper understanding of Naive Bayes.
