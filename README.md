======

![](images/dare_to_be_naive.jpeg)

Naive Bayes is a fundamental machine learning algorithm. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is one of the useful and commonly used classification algorithms. This talk will walk through the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. Common use cases and practical examples will be shown. This talk is designed for beginners who have an interest in machine learning, prior exposure to probability and Python would be helpful to get the most out of it. By the end, you should have a deep understanding of Naive Bayes.
